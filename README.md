# Car-Parking-Buzzer

## Description
An implementation of a parking assistant that notifies the driver about obstacles with visual and audible notifications.

## Features
The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to calculate distance. If the distance is mesured under the permissible limits a buzzer notifies the driver with sound (beeps).
The frequency of beeps increases as the vehicle approaches the obstacles. The driver is also getting notified through a LCD monitor.
